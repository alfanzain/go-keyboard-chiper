# Keyboard Cipher

My wife is a mysterious woman. She loves hide her complains with Keyboard Shift Cipher. So, I build this.

## Overview

This service provides an API endpoint to decode (and (possibly, in the future,) encode) text that has been shifted one (and (again, possibly) more than one) key to the right or left on a QWERTY keyboard. For example, "O" becomes "I" since "I" is one key to the left of "O" on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24.1 or higher

### Usage

```
GET /decode?input=this should be a encoded string by keyboard shift chiper
```

### Installation

My Cursor credit ran out. I know you can figure it out. Well, I'll update this soon (very soon, trust me).

### Contribution

Got more idea on how to make my life as a husband of a mysterious wife easier?
